My theory is that tasks like sentiment analysis and toxicity detection provide a high level view and an empirical representation of textual engagement.\n","\n","Large YouTube channels receive such a high number of comments that it becomes infeasible to read them all especially as new comments are posted. Such a reading and assessment would additionally be qualitative in nature. It also seems that creators engage with the comment section soon after a video is published, but neglect the wealth of information found there as time passes. Creators therefore have a tendency to view and respond to early feedback while not considering recent comments.\n","\n","This type of project takes steps to provide insights into the comment section to potentially enable creator decision making.\n","\n","**Outline**\n"," 1.

_vox_ , you've laid out the downsides of treating areas hit by natural disasters like war zones. that's great.\\n\\n\\n\\nbut, surely, you want to do more than just push a narrative, or than just put yourself on a pedestal as the ethical news outlet while condemning all your competitors, right? if that's indeed what you want, you might want to dedicate a section on the *positive effects* of treating areas devastated by natural disasters like war zones. just to, you know, give the full picture? of course..... it would have been better to do this in this very video, but i guess anybody can make mistakes. and i'm *sure* you would be willing to correct this oversight.\\n\\nalso, of course, you didn't exactly provide a good alternative, which is also not a very good idea if you want to do some actual, you know.... reporting.\\n\\nas for those possible positive effects i mentioned, here are a few ideas.\\nfor example, it *does* seem to be true that people are more willing to help other people when such mindsets are needed most, like after a large percentage of the houses in an area is destroyed by a hurricane. now that you mention it, i think this could actually be used to combat the alleged looter myth.\\nspeaking of which.... it seems to me that it's not so much the covering of looting that's the problem, but the fact that there is no actual data attached to such reporting. if you compare the number of break-ins of, say, electronic appliances stores _[this would be a better fit than grocery stores, as that way one can better differentiate between looting and scavenging]_ in the week after the disaster to the number in the week before the disaster -- or something like that -- you can tell the people how much the problem of looting is *actually* a problem. if the number of break-ins in this category has gone up significantly, then maybe something needs to be done. but you say that shouldn't be the case. okay then: this will show in the data. and, by *showing* that data, you can alleviate people's fears of looting in the case of future disasters.\\nthirdly, treating these areas like war zones gives the opportunity to compare the devastation brought by these hurricanes to what happened with previous ones. this would seem to be a much more effective way to communicate the very direct effect man-made climate change has on the personal lives of people, then comparing wind velocities, rain output, and the wingspan of a hurricane. and isn't that, after all, the goal of reporting? to convey the message that needs to be conveyed in as effective a way as possible?\\nfinally, an example of not so much a positive, but more a non-negative. you can't really blame people for wanting to stay living where they live, even if that's in a flooding plane. you should instead blame the policies that have led to there being houses where there shouldn't be, and the lack of policies to incentivize people to move. of course, the adage is that, in the wake of a disaster, the victims / survivors are more important than politics -- and this is true. and people are going to show perseverance in the wake of adversity, and all that, and proclaim they will rebuild and not let these hardships keep them down. should news outlets simply cut those statements out, thus betraying the people who were kind enough to speak to the reporters, even though we can be sure they had more important things on their minds? the question of what period to allot to covering the direct, personal impacts of disasters, and when to transition more to the context of disasters and why they happen, is a very difficult one. maybe you could answer that question in your next video, seeing as you act like you'd know the answers to such questions.\\n\\ni'm not saying there aren't downsides to the way natural disasters are portrayed by the media -- major downsides, even. what did you expect? it's the media.\\nhowever, i *am* saying i look forward to the follow-up to the video on this page. because after being confronted with such massive oversights, there is no way you won't post one, right? right?!\n","4090\n","god’s message to mankind by maester patrick \\n(i.s.o.b.p. -

not condone your sins. “good” people have committed sins as well. as you have not lived a perfect life. nor has anyone else. your sins have made you a sinner before god. the penalty for your sins is the curse of death.\\nhowever there is good news: someone who never committed a sin, can be your substitution, such a person may carry your judgment for your sins, in your place.\\ngod’s love for you inspired him to send his son, who’s capable of living a life without sin, and made him undergo the curse of death in your place.\\nthis is how eternal life becomes accessible to you. as jesus, gods son, never committed a sin during his earthly life, so by the law of sin and death, god was obligated to resurrect him, rightfully, as that law only applies to sinners.\\neternal life cannot be obtained by means of money, nor is there a way to “earn” the right that god pardons you from the curse of death with your own efforts of recompense for your sins. you are unable to “deserve” it, it’s a gift from god.\\nits up to you to choose if you accept this gift, and when you do so, god arranged the forgiveness of your sins and will choose to forget that you ever committed them.\\nthose who accept this gift will become sons and daughters of god, and no longer be separated from him. such will receive access to the holy spirit and will dwell in heaven with god in the afterlife.\\nafter your reunition with god, the holy spirit will help you to not return to that old lifestyle of committing sins, lest you become separated from god again, nor should you desire to be found abusing god’

thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet — it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little.\\nthere's also _another_ clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's _minus_ the sum of the packet data.  this means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the _whole_ packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.

well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?\\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in chicago\\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in baltimore\\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in detroit\\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in washington d.c. (a 54% increase over prior years)\\n\\nso basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. all 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\\n\\nthis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. that is an average because some states have much higher rates than others. for example, california had 1,169 and alabama had 1.\\n\\nnow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? california, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. it is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. so if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\\n\\nare 5,100 deaths per year horrific? how about in comparison to other deaths? all death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. that's why they are criminals.\\n\\nbut what about other deaths each year?\\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–there is no excuse for that!\\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths\\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) \\n\\nnow it gets good:\\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. you are safer in chicago than when you are in a hospital!\\n\\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. it’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! so what is the point? if obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). a 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!\\n\\nso you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? it's pretty simple.:\\ntaking away guns gives control to governments.\\n\\nthe founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the british did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. it is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\\n\\nthus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the u.s. constitution. it must be preserved at all costs. \\n\\nso the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from noah webster: before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in europe. the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the united states. a

of the points made started off with the wrong premise, although the intentions were good. \\n\\nbefore making my remarks, all of these deductions, no matter how much we don't like them, have some sort of logic behind them; let's not display them as being senseless rules just put in place for no reason. in order to make better policy we must look at why we are doing the things the way we are. if they are not working, we must determine why the logic behind the original way of doing things did not work and then make changes. so if we're arguing against something let's make sure we explain why it is being done like this in the first place. \\n\\npoint 1 (charitable deduction)\\nyou started off by saying that both men gave 100 dollars. already you've misconstrued the logic behind the deduction. the poorer man does not give to charity in equal weight as does the richer man, this is just fact. a lower class blue collar worker cannot give the billions to charity as does bill gates, it's not possible. so the correct premise for discussing this deduction would be dan gives $100 to charity and steve gives $1000 to charity. the point of this deduction was to encourage the rich to be charitable instead of stashing their extra wealth. if this deduction were to be changed, it would be less of a encouragement for the rich to be charitable. they would still do it but there's no logical way you can convince me that they would do it just as much as before with the incentive. i've also noticed that your proposal was to make even across at 15%? that means nothing would have changed for dan, the only thing you've changed is the incentive for the rich to give their money away. \\n\\npoint 2 (mortgage deduction)\\nso you're telling me that what $362 is to dan, $960 is to steve? you said the savings were 3x as much for steve. let's compare steve's income to dan's. 500,000/30,000 = 16.667 or 16. so steve makes 16x as much as dan makes and saves 3x as much as dan does. so his incentives don't reflect the wage gap. \\n\\npoint 3 (earned wage vs. unearned wage)\\nsimilar to point 1, you stated that two people in earned/unearned wage categories both make $500,000 a year. this is a misconstrued premise. a point you forgot to mention about the unearned wage category is that they do not make a steady income as do the earned wage category. let's take for example a house flipper, their income depends on how successful they are at updating the house, location, economy, and several other factors i'm not knowledgeable enough to state. the reason for the gap in deductions between the earned/unearned wage categories is because the unearned does not make a steady income. so the correct premise for this discussion is an earned wage worker makes 500k a year and an unearned wage worker makes 500k a year but other times makes 250k. so if we want to discuss this, we have to look at individual sectors and look at how often do unearned wage workers make the low end of their unearned wage in each sector. based on patterns we can discuss deductions for unearned wage workers in each individual sector (stock market, house flippers, etc.). so if individuals in a specific sector consistently make the top end of their wage, we can adjust their deductions to look more like the earned wage worker. \\n\\nbias is when a point is presented in a specific light to make the unbiased viewer shift to adopt the opinion projected by the presenter. if a point is presented in red the viewer will see it in red. present day media everyone. no more discussions just brainwashed democratic socialists and always trumpers. \\n\\nlet's discuss these topics but let's do it in the right way. the capitalistic theme overhangs all of these tax deductions and i think we should discuss those bigger topics instead of these smaller derived ones. capitalism vs. socialism. i think capitalism works and socialism does not, relative to the world our poor class is richer than the middle class of other countries. we must fight for the less fortunate, but let's look at things logically and not emotionally.\n","4211\n","as a cpa, i find i disagree with much of what is said in this video.  dan & steve save on taxes in different amounts because they are in different tax brackets.  no kidding.  however, you fail to see that steve is paying twice the rate in taxes! isn't steve a hero?  he's paying for someone else government entitlements. if he makes enough, he could be paying the way for 10 people, who knows?\\n\\nthe idea that if we take away certain deductions because it costs the government money is ludicrous.  it's not their money! the money you earn is yours, not the government's!  you and i don't live for the benefit of the government, the government works for us... and should do it on a budget.\\n\\nthe idea that all these deductions are not fair to the poor is bogus.  if dan bought a house for $100k and earned $30k a year, he probably wouldn't itemize his deductions because the standard deduction would likely be much higher.  the tax law gives him a freebie and he doesn't have to own a home to get the benefit.  if he's single and younger than 65, it is $6,300, married couples get double that. the new tax law proposed would double the standard deductions!  way to go dan! you're going to save a lot more money on taxes. i and many other home owners who are able  itemize our deductions (deducting mortgage interest and property taxes), however, are not so fortunate. the current plan is to eliminate the property tax and state income tax deductions.  so now dan can double his deductions and i lose about 25% of my itemized deductions.  i will pay a lot more in tax than dan, but because i own a home and am rich it's only fair that i should lose some of my deductions.\\n\\nhere is some more misinformation.  gambling losses are deductible up to your winnings.  you can never get a tax advantage losing money at a casino.  business meals are only 50% deductible and 9 out of 10 times, it's deducted on a small business return (schedule c).  if you run your own business (sole proprietorship) and see that you get to pay self-employment tax (15.3%) and income tax, you'd wish the irs would let you deduct 100% of those business lunches.  yes, big businesses get the same deduction too so i don't see the real advantage for the big guys (corporations).  retirement account contributions are deductible for everyone.  deductions for your income tax preparation fee is subject to a 2% of agi limitation.  basically, if you can itemize your deductions, you can deduct the portion of your tax prep fee that exceeds 2% of your income.  so if you make $100k, the first $2000 of your tax prep fee is not deductible, anything beyond that is.  you might have some other types of expenses in this category, but by and large, there are aren't many taxpayers with those types of deductions.  oh, and no one earning $100k pays and accountant any where near $2000 for their tax return. \\n\\nin 2013, the top 5% of taxpayers (agi of about $180k or more) paid 59% of all the income tax.  the bottom 50% paid only 3%.  the progressive tax system is working exactly as the government has designed it.  the rich pay more, the poor pay little or nothing.  on a side note, they failed to mention the earned income credit... you know, the cash the irs will give you if you earn too little?  this is especially helpful to those with children. if you have three children and your income is just at the right level, you can get over $6000 paid to you.\\n\\ngood grief!  now capital gains??!! when capital gains tax increase you have billions of dollars stuck in properties, stocks, and any other appreciating assets.  people are less likely to sell their stock if they have to pay up to 34% (combined fed and ca on their investments).  also as the assets appreciate, no one ever mentions that part of that appreciation is in the form of inflation so the true gain is not what you think it is.  your investment isn't as valuable as you think because inflation eats away at some of it, but the tax code doesn't care.  you pay the full tax on the growth, not its true purchasing power.  and what if you make a bad investment?  if you sold ibm stock for a $50,000 loss and had no other capital gains, you get to deduct $3000, not the full $50,000.  thank goodness you can carry the remaining $47k loss to the next year and deduct another $3k if you again don't have any capital gains.  people who invest money are not evil.  warren buffet is in a lower tax bracket but i'll bet his total tax is at least 1000 times what his secretary pays. \\n\\nyou might double check me on this one, but i believe hedge fund managers get paid a salary... plus bonuses.  so they pay the same tax as steve. i'm not aware of managers getting compensated in mutual funds or whatever they are indicating here.\\n\\nso cutting the top tax rate helps the wealthiest. that makes sense since 50% of our fellow citizens pay 3%.  the whole subliminal tone is that rich people are somehow cheaters because they aren't paying more than they already do.  why vilify those who earn more?  i'd bet 99% of the those in the bottom 50% would love to be in the top 50%. why is it bad when someone else is wealthy but not when i'm wealthy? this video just pushes that narrative.  \\n\\nhmmm... they seem to have  forgotten to mention the alternative minimum tax... you know the one that ensures the richest americans pay a minimum amount (about 28%) no matter the deductions or credits they have.  oh did they fail to mention that because congress can't get its act together, the amt tax affects a greater amount of tax payers than it ever has... and by that i mean middle class.  the threshold income numbers haven't kept up with income so it affects more and more tax payers. \\n trump talked about repealing it.  this would be a huge benefit to the middle class.  \\n\\nfinally, the idea that somehow income has to be equal is idiotic at best.  if every ones' wealth goes up but those on the higher end see their wealth grow faster,  how is that bad for the guy on the lower end?   his income went up too. this income disparity is always couched in such a way that rich people earn more and poor people earn less.  that's not true.  we act like no one can become richer if they didn't already come from a family of wealth.  there are millions of americans that love what they do and don't find gratification in earning tons of money.  these are choices we all make. anytime a government tries to make things equal it inevitably means pick on the rich and pander for votes from the poor.  this is all for political expediency... at least, that's my two cents.\n","6583\n","unless this video was strictly created as propaganda, i am very disappointed at the level of misleading statements made here.\\n\\nfirstly, many people have criticized reagan for trickle down economics, but now this video says his economic policy was good. come on. you can't call his ideas good only when you are trying to make someone else's look bad. reagan's plan included charitable deductions and home interest deductions, so please don't pretend that he was doing something much different. plus the current gop bill is pushing for closing carried interest, which is something no hedge fund manager or real estate investor would ever want to happen, as it would substantially increase their effective tax. this strangely is not even mentioned. it also failed to mention that dan would pay less in tax even with a 12% tax bracket since the standard deduction would shield over $12k of his income from taxes, which means it's mathematically impossible for him to pay more taxes if that plan were enacted as described.\\n\\nnext, this video is saying that dan gets less of a benefit than steve on many things. unfortunately, this video is missing the point entirely. dan gets more benefit than steve relative to dan's level of income when it comes to mortgage interest deductions. \\n\\nexample:\\n\\ndan saves $362 from his interest deduction, which is equal to 1.2% of dan's income. steve saves $960 on same sized interest deduction, which is equal to 0.2% of steve's income. in other words, dan gets six times the benefit relative to his income than does steve. this is a consequence of a progressive tax system.\\n\\nbut what if dan and steve both paid 15% income tax. that would eliminate this problem altogether, would it not? now steve would pay $362, just like dan. obviously, that's not what the people making this video are advocating.\\n\\nfurthermore, saying that the wealthy benefit mostly from mortgage interest deductions is silly, because a household making $200k a year isn't wealthy. it's middle class. the middle class disproportionately benefit from mortgage interest deductions. the genuinely wealthy usually own their home(s) outright.\\n\\nanyway, as others have already noted, higher income earners pay a greater share of taxes by far then the percent of income earned:\\n\\nin 2013, the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers (those with agis below $36,841) earned 11.49 percent of total agi. this group of taxpayers paid approximately $34 billion in taxes, or 2.78 percent of all income taxes in 2013. in contrast, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers (taxpayers with agis of $428,713 and above), earned 19.04 percent of all agi in 2013, but paid 37.80 percent of all federal income taxes. in 2013, the top 1 percent of taxpayers accounted for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined. the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid $465 billion, or 37.80 percent of all income taxes, while the bottom 90 percent paid $372 billion, or 30.20 percent of all income taxes.\\n\\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2015-update/\\n\\nbottom 50% were 11.49% a income, but paid 2.78% on income taxes.\\ntop 1% were 19.04 percent of income, and paid 37.80% of income taxes.\\n\\nclearly, the top shoulders more than their representative share of taxes, many times more.\\n\\n\\n\\ncapital gains is not about frequently buying and selling stock. if you do that, it's taxed as regular income. the only exception to this is futures contracts, which is why people with modest portfolios got into managed futures accounts in the last decade since it did allow part of the profits to be taxed as if they are capital gains. however, equities (stocks, bonds, etc.) will always be taxed as income if profits are realized within a calendar year after those assets were purchased. if you hold them longer than a year, then they are not. generally speaking, people who are in the stock market just hold their stocks for years and years. if you have a 401k, this includes you.\\n\\nthe hedge fund manager example is misguided too. if laurie has her own money in the hedge fund, then profits she earns on her money will be taxed as capital gains as long as time it took her to make that money exceeds one year. however, any share of the profits she gets from client's money is taxed as income to her, but would be capital gains to them as long as the hold time was long enough. \\n\\nwarren buffett is a stakeholder in berkshire hathaway, which is his investment company who's assets are the stocks the company is invested in. since berkshire issues its own shares, and buffet owns about 11% of those shares, and he is a long term investor, his income is taxed as capital gains. however, if he was not a stakeholder but derived income as a salary, then he would pay a higher tax rate. the point is that your income tax as a fund manager is dictated by what equity you have in the fund. if you have none but you are paid to manage the fund, then you will pay regular income tax.\\n\\nlastly, as far as charity is concerned, if you do the math you'll see that if your tax rate is above 50%, then you should give half your earnings to charity as you will take home more money overall, but if the tax rate is below 50% then it's better to not give to charity at all if you want to take home as much money as possible.\n","5313\n","around the

in this subject make some more research if this video is the only thing you have seen about this subject. there are some big pieces of information missing like the fact that dominican republic had to fight for its independence from haiti (like other commenter said).\\n\\ni think that this video is biased in favor of haiti. i also have to admit that i'm biased in favor of dominican republic, because thats my country, were i've live all my life, from were i'm writing right now. i think that it's true that there is racism in dominican republic, against black people from any part of the world, including black dominicans. i think that is true that we have xenophobia against haitians. we also have machismo and homophobia and lots of other problems in various degrees spread in the population. but so does any other country in the world, included haiti. thats not an excuse, a lot of people here in dr fight against those problems, i do. but i also think that as a free and independent country we should have a better control of our frontier. of course paying the right respect to our brothers haitians. that said, in general most of the dominicans live in peace with haitians, even knowing if they have or don't have papers and with black people, dominican republic have a lot of black people as you could saw on the video.\\n\\nbut we are also a poor country, our gdp that looks good for our small country is badly administrated and badly distributed. we have a lot of corruption too and part of that corruption is reflected on the way the frontier is administrated. the little bit of resources that really get to our hospitals have to be shared with haitian womans who come here just to give birth, and they get the attention, for free. that is why they keep coming. but the thing is that dominicans have to take care of dominicans first, and all the problems we have, in health, in education, in nutrition, we don't even have an electric system that works completely all the time, shut-downs are normal here, except for a few special neighborhoods in the capital. we help haiti as much as we can because after all they are our brothers. i've even said some times that the people from the united states have made us far worst things than the haitians (2 invasions, lots of political issues, bad influence), so we should be more careful with gringos than with our brothers haitians that have even helped us at some battles.\n","2606\n","wtf is my mans illness.  cause colin protested and trump made a comment about them doing it..... always been a fan of em,  favorite rap artist etc etc.  but now i'm not sure yo... this shit made no sense. almost like he just wanting black people thinking look guys,  i'm with you,  i'm rapping on behalf of you all,  look at me.  and trump never said anything bout black people,  or the black players  being spoiled rich  athletes etc etc.  and now all this gonna do is cause even more racist tension and issues that were not there before and don't need to be,  by saying what he just did and being as influential as the man is knows he has power to alot of people's to cause these shits,  dividing america. he's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man. he is a rich illuminati affiliated high up involved with agenda to rip us all part from eachother and all the ones that are saying your the shit em,  good job em,  ohhh he cares so much about all this shit , please wake the hell up peoples,  for real.  common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the hurd. funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, i bet everything,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. also waiting for everything to stop.... he aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if any of you believe that then i truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.  we as americans need to stick together with all colors  and sex.  real talk.  trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  ain't am easy job by any means period.  and fir anyone that's a believer of our lord and savior which i hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most definitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our president .  what this man just did or is doing i should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actually not!!! much more id like to say friends and things i know i probably forgot but its late, i'm very tired and gonna stop before i start going off in different directions off topic etc etc.  plus my wife is giving me that look,  ha. time for bed .  thanks everyone for your time and have a blessed day when your up.... take care and be safe.\n","3105\n","hey eminem, let me go ahead and spit at you!\\ni'm gonna tell you straight-up, dude, you're so hypocritical,\\nit's pitiful!\\nyou call trump a racist, yet you call him

wasn't a crime committed by muslims!! there was a stand down of us military fighter jets, when they knew the several planes had been hijacked! 10 of the hijackers are still alive and were freed back to their home country after several months of being held in the us. several even appeared on tv shows in their own country and did interviews. building 7 of the world trade centers had preplanted explosives all throughout the building before the attacks, placed by cia agents, one of which openly admitted on his death bed to  him and 3 others being ordered to place them as he was an engineer. the owner of the world trade centers 1 & 2 larry silverstien, then apparently ordered the firefighters to pull the building while it had been burning constantly for hours, which he himself unequivocally says he said to pull it in a famous interview which he later regretted. demolition  charges would take weeks to be placed all throughout the building, and firefighters do not even do that. that is not at all a part of their protocol or job training. larry silverstein took out an insurance policy protecting the buildings against terrorist attacks 2 months before the 9/11 attacks and profited over $7 billion from their destruction from the insurance policy. there were power downs of the world trade centers a week before the attacks in which engineers were walking in and out of the building unobserved by security. security of the building which was headed by g bush's cousin. explosives are how the world trade centers 1 & 2 were collapsed. fires alone do not burn hot enough to collapse industrial steel beams and there is extensive evidence to prove this. phone calls cannot be made from airplanes above 7,000 feet max and the planes travel too fast for the signal to smoothly be transferred from phone tower to phone tower and the phone calls are dropped, yet the records show phone continuous phone calls over 18 minutes on the hijacked planes and phony flight attendant calling back more than once. no plane hit the pentagon, it was planted explosives. there was no airplane debris characteristic to an airplane crash, the width of the building where the wings would have impacted still had fully intact windows. the hijacked planes were taken control over by a remote flight control system sold to the airlines in the 80's and had been around since the 70's where the military can take control over the airplanes controls and fly it like a drone in case of an emergency and the pilot isn't able. the hijacked planes were taken control of by this system, and landed at westover airforce base in western ma and hidden in hangers used for storing large c-5 transport planes, where the passengers were then gassed to death in the planes on the ground. one plane was not able to be taken over and controlled and landed at an airport in cleveland ohio due to the stand down of all airlines ordered by the airports. the hijacked planes were replaced in air with something different without it showing up on the radars which is a specific military operation protocol to replace a plane with another and have it unknown. the air force base where the hijacked planes landed was completely locked out to military personnel for 3 days! due to a military/government drill taking place the day of 9/11 training for an all out war scenario. keep in mind this drill was planned and scheduled before 9/11 when the attacks took place. there is undeniable extensive evidence of all of this! this was not done by the america government we know and love but by corrupt entities in positions of too much power scattered throughout the us government and world with their own agenda actually something they were kinda born into. the zionist rothschild mossad is the collection of knowledge and mindset responsible for this extensive operation to take place. they forced bush to then commit war against muslims after the attack as the scapegoats. zionist jews did 911 and blamed it on the arabs, iraq are enemies of isreal and the us fought them for them. this whole war has been a manufactured plot to serve an elite few of others interests. and of course the story we have all known for over 15 years is manufactured! i know it is almost completely unbelievable at first but, there is countless clear facts and evidence that the story america was told was not the truth. the vietnam war was manufactured based on a lie of events in a similar way to serve an elite fews interests. god bless you.\n","4484\n","love it!!! it's so halarious seeing kylo ren choke his

particular items, as they know little to nothing about these said topics? it is because, once something is old enough, no one can ever question its greatness. if you want to try to come across as intelligent, when you’re really not, become a sycophant; then, you can recite all the traditional works of art your teachers spoon-feed you; thus, allowing you to come across as a blind buffoon acting as intelligent. why bother actually looking into traditional media, having actual exposure while developing an understanding, when one can simply say they respect it by reciting what their told in school? also, dismiss any modern artists/material, pretending to have respect for the classical titles that you have never devoted the time or energy to see, hear or read -- opt out of seeing dunkirk or logan lucky, chose to see the latest happy madison production, laugh at all the jokes while claiming the film was awesome, but claim to have deep respect for alfred hitchcock films they have never

biblical prophecy - youtube.com/isobp )\\n\\naccept this gift: pray to jesus and ask for your sins to be covered then seek water baptism.\\n\\ngod loves you. however, god does not condone your sins. “good” people have committed sins as well. as you have not lived a perfect life. nor has anyone else. your sins have made you a sinner before god. the penalty for your sins is the curse of death.\\nhowever there is good news: someone who never committed a sin, can be your substitution, such a person may carry your judgment for your sins, in your place.\\ngod’s love for you inspired him to send his son, who’s capable of living a life without sin, and made him undergo the curse of death in your place.\\nthis is how eternal life becomes accessible to you. as jesus, gods son, never committed a sin during his earthly life, so by the law of sin and death, god was obligated to resurrect him, rightfully, as that law only applies to sinners.\\neternal life cannot be obtained by means of money, nor is there a way to “earn” the right that god pardons you from the curse of death with your own efforts of recompense for your sins. you are unable to “deserve” it, it’s a gift from god.\\nits up to you to choose if you accept this gift, and when you do so, god arranged the forgiveness of your sins and will choose to forget that you ever committed them.\\nthose who accept this gift will become sons and daughters of god, and no longer be separated from him. such will receive access to the holy spirit and will dwell in heaven with god in the afterlife.\\nafter your reunition with god, the holy spirit will help you to not return to that old lifestyle of committing sins, lest you become separated from god again, nor should you desire to be found abusing god’ grace upon you.\\n\\nsource:  psalm 100:5, deuteronomy 28, romans 3:23, isaiah 59:2, hebrews 4:15, 2 corinth 5:21 hebrews 9:12, john 11:25, galatians 2:16, ephesians 2:8, isaiah 43:25, galatians 3:26, romans

(string theory, for example - my apologies to brian greene for my poor attempt that may butcher his excellent explanations (i'm only a lowly engineer - but a very curious and happy one  :)  )  this is an intriguing idea that the biological processes and physical world we live under are actually being simulated at the sub-sub-sub atomic levels, and therefore we are actually blobs of proteins and lipids evolving for real in this simulation.  seems to me a lot of trouble to cover conscience awareness of each being if you can simulate the real universe down to whatever the real truth is (23 dimensional strings vs 10 dimensional, closed vs. open, vibrating vs. whatever)\\n\\n the same argument you made for the very big, godlike civilization would also apply to this thought experiment.  but there are already some heavy hitters on it.  several publications of proposed tests have been written, and are quite entertaining to even this lowly engineer.  (but still a science geek).  my personal favorite so far is the holographic paradox.  how does this quantum-level simulation stand up to what we know of black holes, where quantum fails? (still working on that unified theory thing).  if we are a simulation, an outsider would see it in n-1 dimensions.  can they observe without affecting it?  \\n\\nbut that's where my feeble attempt to understand cosmology becomes something like roy batty wanting to live a few more years.  i go into a depressed nihilism mode where i don't have any friends to discuss this over late night, fire-lit, drinking evenings.  seems to me this simulation is doing a good job of trying to kill us with asteroids, radiation, grb's, genetic defects, and not to mention several thousand megaton fusion warheads (each) pointed at each other with a hair trigger of nervous and tired command and control crews.  i personally don't like the aging thing.  would be great if i could get a second degree for fun and learning instead of putting food on the table...  biological decrepitude is getting in the way.  but i digress again.  nice cartoon btw!\n","3881\n","4:14 no, it's cleverer than that.  the uppermost bits overflow _into_ the lower bits: it's called ones' complement or end-around carry.  this is because the values to be summed are not the individual octets but rather _pairs_ of octets treated as 16-bit numbers.  thanks to this clever ones' complement hack, it doesn't matter whether your computer is a 386 that thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet — it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little.\\nthere's also _another_ clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's _minus_ the sum of the packet data.  this means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the _whole_ packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.

that's not realised is that, if we can create our own simulations, it would break the very computer operating our universe. as it has been proven that a computer cannot simulate another computer as or more powerful than itself. you can't simulate a gaming pc on your phone, or even another phone(with the exact same specs as your current phonr) on your own phone because it takes processing power to run both your operating system, and the simulations and the specs deticated to the simulation. so it is impossible, unless the computer your simulating is slower than the original. then your good, but other than that? no. just no.\\n\\nso, there is a way to test if we are in a simulation. we build a quantum computer the size of new york city. then, we boot it up and try to run our own simulations. if we are in a simulation, our reality would cease to exist and the original computer crashes from having an extreme overload. if we aren't in a simulation... the computer will work just fine and... be running simulations... meaning that our lives do have meaning and aren't some fabric of some digital world... that the microbes that we observe are still there when we aren't looking... that our bodies really are full of bubbly stuff, even if they aren't open... meaning that the atoms inside a log are still their even though you can't see them... that nothing is empty, everything we see exist and will still exist... \\n\\n\\nessentially it's the opposite of an existential crisis... which is worse, because instead of finding yourself pointless, you regret the bad things you did in the

it was one of those things you don't realize you want to know more about, but is interesting and handy. the first overrated epi i saw was the qwerty keyboard one. i wasn't sure how i felt about it. it seemed at first like it was bashing for bashing's sake. he said that using something without knowing why it's the thing we use is the definition of overrated, which isn't right. so in his pov, solo cups are vastly overrated? it felt like hating for no reason. the first overrated video was about a specific book i wasn't that interested in, so i didn't watch it. so i expect it to be hit or miss, but if it sticks to broader things that most people deal with, like the way movie theaters work or tipping and why you up some people and cases in which you probably should tip people and you don't realize it, that would be more appealing to more people. the more specific you get, the fewer people watch, but the higher the level of interest. so broad and shallow may be the way to go if views are the goal. the point that the nuance is what's lacking in open offices is a very good point. they can't take half a recipe and expect to have a perfect result, and that's what many companies have done. also, the open office thing came back after open floor plans in houses came back into vogue. i was a little surprised it wasn't mentioned, because that kind of carry over in thinking happens so often. but just because it increases functionality in one case doesn't mean it's ideal for another, and it's problematic for workers. i'm so happy that i work from home for now. :grinning_face_with_sweat: i'd get so much less done if i had to deal with other people stopping by or the loud chewing or talking of a nearby employee. i also get migraines from a lot of perfumes, so i'd be *that* person who always seems to make a fuss over nothing. all in all, it was a good video. better than the previous episode. i'm curious to see what they cover next!\n","2127\n","there are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. u.s. population 324,059,091 as of wednesday, june 22, 2016. do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. statistically speaking, this is insignificant! what is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\\n\\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws\\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified\\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence\\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths\\n\\nso technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. still too many? well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?\\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in chicago\\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in baltimore\\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in detroit\\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in washington d.c. (a 54% increase over prior years)\\n\\nso basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. all 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\\n\\nthis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. that is an average because some states have much higher rates than others. for example, california had 1,169 and alabama had 1.\\n\\nnow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? california, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. it is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. so if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\\n\\nare 5,100 deaths per year horrific? how about in comparison to other deaths? all death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. that's why they are criminals.\\n\\nbut what about other deaths each year?\\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–there is no excuse for that!\\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths\\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) \\n\\nnow it gets good:\\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. you are safer in chicago than when you are in a hospital!\\n\\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. it’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! so what is the point? if obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). a 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!\\n\\nso you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? it's pretty simple.:\\ntaking away guns gives control to governments.\\n\\nthe founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the british did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. it is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\\n\\nthus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the u.s. constitution. it must be preserved at all costs. \\n\\nso the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from noah webster: before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in europe. the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the united states. a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.\\n\\nremember, when it comes to gun control, the important word is “control, not “gun.\n","4384\n","spot the difference

doubt this will causes some opinions and before is start i would like to say i don't dislike the people i just dislike what they do but that's there choice i don't have the right to judge. \\n\\nmy comment is.. is anyone else hoping they don't put a homosexual in this film. reason i'm asking is i just watched the new ep star trek discovery last night and once again we are forced a homosexual even tho the story didn't need or benefit from there being one. there seams to be this trend at the moment where a person of that sexuality is shown off as a amazing person who we should all love even tho it's takes away from the story think back to the last star trek film what dose everyone remember from that film bet it wasn't the story i can't even remember the name of it all i remember is the fact that zulu is a homosexual and that because it was forced even the original actor of zulu said it was too forced. when you do that it takes the whole focus of the movie off the story and on to them. \\n\\nnow this is far from being star wars but downtown abbey did it best that show had the butler who was a homosexual but it wasn't forced in your face he was just a part of the story and he wasn't shown off as this amazing person infact he was the villain of a number of episodes so if your gonna add someone like that in do it so the people who don't care can still enjoy the story without it being forced in your face. \\n\\npersonally i would like it of they just stopped adding them in to movies or storys not becuse i dislike them but because it takes away from the story.\\n\\nin ten years we should look back on this star wars as having a great story we should not look back in 10 years as this being the first star wars with a homosexual that's not what star wars was about.\\n\\nwhat i'm trying to say is if you wanna have a homosexual in a story add them on the first ep or first movie don't add them half way through just for the sake of it. star trek was about the crew saving the galaxy exploring the galaxy and getting in to trouble it was never about who likes who but that's what it's like today. star was has always been about good battling evil and that how it should stay. \\n\\nin a nutshell don't add them just for publicity or just for the sake of it if your gonna add them do it so it dosnt come across as being this big part of the story.\\n now please don't send hate all i wanna know is dose anyone else feel the same or is it just me. i will delete this comment if it gets to much attention. and i don't dislike homosexual people i just don't agree with what they do but what they do is there choice and i'm not judging because it's not my place\n","2667\n","wtf is my mans illness.  cause colin protested and trump made a comment about them doing it..... always been a fan of em,  favorite rap artist etc etc.  but now i'm not sure yo... this shit made no sense. almost like he just wanting black people thinking look guys,  i'm with you,  i'm rapping on behalf of you all,  look at me.  and trump never said anything bout black people,  or the black players  being spoiled rich  athletes etc etc.  and now all this gonna do is cause even more racist tension and issues that were not there before and don't need to be,  by saying what he just did and being as influential as the man is knows he has power to alot of people's to cause these shits,  dividing america. he's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man. he is a rich illuminati affiliated high up involved with agenda to rip us all part from eachother and all the ones that are saying your the shit em,  good job em,  ohhh he cares so much about all this shit , please wake the hell up peoples,  for real.  common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the hurd. funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, i bet everything,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. also waiting for everything to stop.... he aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if any of you believe that then i truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.  we as americans need to stick together with all colors  and sex.  real talk.  trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  ain't am easy job by any means period.  and fir anyone that's a believer of our lord and savior which i hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most definitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our president .  what this man just did or is doing i should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actually not!!! much more id like to say friends and things i know i probably forgot but its late, i'm very tired

_vox_ , you've laid out the downsides of treating areas hit by natural disasters like war zones. that's great.\\n\\n\\n\\nbut, surely, you want to do more than just push a narrative, or than just put yourself on a pedestal as the ethical news outlet while condemning all your competitors, right? if that's indeed what you want, you might want to dedicate a section on the *positive effects* of treating areas devastated by natural disasters like war zones. just to, you know, give the full picture? of course..... it would have been better to do this in this very video, but i guess anybody can make mistakes. and i'm *sure* you would be willing to correct this oversight.\\n\\nalso, of course, you didn't exactly provide a good alternative, which is also not a very good idea if you want to do some actual, you know.... reporting.\\n\\nas for those possible positive effects i mentioned, here are a few ideas.\\nfor example, it *does* seem to be true that people are more willing to help other people when such mindsets are needed most, like after a large percentage of the houses in an area is destroyed by a hurricane. now that you mention it, i think this could actually be used to combat the alleged looter myth.\\nspeaking of which.... it seems to me that it's not so much the covering of looting that's the problem, but the fact that there is no actual data attached to such reporting. if you compare the number of break-ins of, say, electronic appliances stores _[this would be a better fit than grocery stores, as that way one can better differentiate between looting and scavenging]_ in the week after the disaster to the number in the week before the disaster -- or something like that -- you can tell the people how much the problem of looting is *actually* a problem. if the number of break-ins in this category has gone up significantly, then maybe something needs to be done. but you say that shouldn't be the case. okay then: this will show in the data. and, by *showing* that data, you can alleviate people's fears of looting in the case of future disasters.\\nthirdly, treating these areas like war zones gives the opportunity to compare the devastation brought by these hurricanes to what happened with previous ones. this would seem to be a much more effective way to communicate the very direct effect man-made climate change has on the personal lives of people, then comparing wind velocities, rain output, and the wingspan of a hurricane. and isn't that, after all, the goal of reporting? to convey the message that needs to be conveyed in as effective a way as possible?\\nfinally, an example of not so much a positive, but more a non-negative. you can't really blame people for wanting to stay living where they live, even if that's in a flooding plane. you should instead blame the policies that have led to there being houses where there shouldn't be, and the lack of policies to incentivize people to move. of course, the adage is that, in the wake of a disaster, the victims / survivors are more important than politics -- and this is true. and people are going to show perseverance in the wake of adversity, and all that, and proclaim they will rebuild and not let these hardships keep them down. should news outlets simply cut those statements out, thus betraying the people who were kind enough to speak to the reporters, even though we can be sure they had more important things on their minds? the question of what period to allot to covering the direct, personal impacts of disasters, and when to transition more to the context of disasters and why they happen, is a very difficult one. maybe you could answer that question in your next video, seeing as you act like you'd know the answers to such questions.\\n\\ni'm not saying there aren't downsides to the way natural disasters are portrayed by the media -- major downsides, even. what did you expect? it's the media.\\nhowever, i *am* saying i look forward to the follow-up to the video on this page. because after being confronted with such massive oversights, there is no way you won't post one, right? right?!\n","4090\n","False\n","god’s message to mankind by maester patrick

accessible to you. as jesus, gods son, never committed a sin during his earthly life, so by the law of sin and death, god was obligated to resurrect him, rightfully, as that law only applies to sinners.\\neternal life cannot be obtained by means of money, nor is there a way to “earn” the right that god pardons you from the curse of death with your own efforts of recompense for your sins. you are unable to “deserve” it, it’s a gift from god.\\nits up to you to choose if you accept this gift, and when you do so, god arranged the forgiveness of your sins and will choose to forget that you ever committed them.\\nthose who accept this gift will become sons and daughters of god, and no longer be separated from him. such will receive access to the holy spirit and will dwell in heaven with god in the afterlife.\\nafter your reunition with god, the holy spirit will help you to not return to that old lifestyle of committing sins, lest you become separated from god again, nor should you

(string theory, for example - my apologies to brian greene for my poor attempt that may butcher his excellent explanations (i'm only a lowly engineer - but a very curious and happy one  :)  )  this is an intriguing idea that the biological processes and physical world we live under are actually being simulated at the sub-sub-sub atomic levels, and therefore we are actually blobs of proteins and lipids evolving for real in this simulation.  seems to me a lot of trouble to cover conscience awareness of each being if you can simulate the real universe down to whatever the real truth is (23 dimensional strings vs 10 dimensional, closed vs. open, vibrating vs. whatever)\\n\\n the same argument you made for the very big, godlike civilization would also apply to this thought experiment.  but there are already some heavy hitters on it.  several publications of proposed tests have been written, and are quite entertaining to even this lowly engineer.  (but still a science geek).  my personal favorite so far is the holographic paradox.  how does this quantum-level simulation stand up to what we know of black holes, where quantum fails?

its ipv6 equivalent, neighbour discovery, is part of icmpv6, sent inside ipv6 datagrams, making it technically a transport layer protocol!\\ncertainly the internet protocol suite _is_ layered, but the trouble with the osi model is that it's so neat and theoretically elaborated that it _sounds_ like it should be a strict and precise thing, whereas real, working networks are inevitably messy and don't follow neat layering boundaries.  see also rfc3439.  while the osi model does give us a few nice names (layer 3, layer 4, and also (though it doesn't actually define it itself) layer 8 for the user's intentions and behaviour layer), it shouldn't be taught without a warning that it's basically a cross between numerology and stamp-collecting.\n","4116\n","False\n","although i agree with the sentiment of the message, it leaves off several details that are of extreme importance.\\n\\nfirst, satellite internet at broadband speeds is available to essentially all americans today from multiple providers.  it is not a great tool for gaming but does meet the broadband requirement.  thus, the first mistake is that the map shown is, in fact, a wireline map.  it does not include any form of wireless - including satellite.\\n\\nsecond, there is an entire part of the story left off of the rea story.  that of the rus - rural us telephone service.  many of those same communities had started telephone service and under the rea the rus was formed to help subsidize rural phone service.  there are around 1,100 local incumbent telephone companies in the us.  the big names (verizon, at&t, frontier, centurylink, fairpoint) you probably have heard of.  but there are plenty of companies like tds or east otter tail telephone, or copper mountain telephone in the us.\\n\\nthese small companies tend to have very good networks because they are subsidized by all of us.  if you see a charge for usf (universal service fund), that is where that money goes to the tune of several $b per year.  many of these companies are co-ops and are owned by the local town.  the biggest problem areas are rural properties of the large companies as they do not receive these subsidies.  they base their builds around their return on investment (roi) and rural broadband falls behind data centers, mobile networking, enterprise fiber optic networks all the time.  they will simply never be built based on their value.\\n\\nthird, wireless internet (wisps) exist and are good in some areas.  we are struggling with spectrum and line of sight issues and it is difficult get permits to build towers.  it can be a solution a bit, but most of the residential wisp connections that exist today do not meet the 25/3 definition of broadband.  it is not likely this is going to change soon.\\n\\nfinally, the solution hinted at existed in the phone world that came about as part of the telecom act of 1934.  pots (plain old telephone service) was made a universal service.  that means that if you build a house, the telephone company must bring you a phone line.  not might, not should, but must by law.  i worked on equipment that supported a cabin that had a 100 mile distance to the co that served it.  that line was not cost effective, but that is why the subsidies exist (and are under the gun to be eliminated).  if we want universal broadband, then we need to legislate universal broadband.  it is the only way.\n","2609\n","False\n","there are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. u.s. population 324,059,091 as of wednesday, june 22, 2016. do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. statistically speaking, this is insignificant! what is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\\n\\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws\\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified\\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence\\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths\\n\\nso technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. still too many? well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?\\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in chicago\\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in baltimore\\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in detroit\\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in washington d.c. (a 54% increase over prior years)\\n\\nso basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. all 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\\n\\nthis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. that is an average because some states have much higher rates than others. for example, california had 1,169 and alabama had 1.\\n\\nnow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? california, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. it is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. so if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\\n\\nare 5,100 deaths per year horrific? how about in comparison to other deaths? all death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. that's why they are criminals.\\n\\nbut what about other deaths each year?\\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–there is no excuse for that!\\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths\\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) \\n\\nnow it gets good:\\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. you are safer in chicago than when you are in a hospital!\\n\\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. it’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! so what is the point? if obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). a 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!\\n\\nso you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? it's pretty simple.:\\ntaking away guns gives control to governments.\\n\\nthe founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the british did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. it is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\\n\\nthus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the u.s. constitution. it must be preserved at all costs. \\n\\nso the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from noah webster: before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in europe. the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the united states. a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.\\n\\nremember, when it comes to gun control, the important word is “control, not “gun.\n","4384\n","False\n","spot the difference

everyone of the points made started off with the wrong premise, although the intentions were good. \\n\\nbefore making my remarks, all of these deductions, no matter how much we don't like them, have some sort of logic behind them; let's not display them as being senseless rules just put in place for no reason. in order to make better policy we must look at why we are doing the things the way we are. if they are not working, we must determine why the logic behind the original way of doing things did not work and then make changes. so if we're arguing against something let's make sure we explain why it is being done like this in the first place. \\n\\npoint 1 (charitable deduction)\\nyou started off by saying that both men gave 100 dollars. already you've misconstrued the logic behind the deduction. the poorer man does not give to charity in equal weight as does the richer man, this is just fact. a lower class blue collar worker cannot give the billions to charity as does bill gates, it's not possible. so the correct premise for discussing this deduction would be dan gives $100 to charity and steve gives $1000 to charity. the point of this deduction was to encourage the rich to be charitable instead of stashing their extra wealth. if this deduction were to be changed, it would be less of a encouragement for the rich to be charitable. they would still do it but there's no logical way you can convince me that they would do it just as much as before with the incentive. i've also noticed that your proposal was to make even across at 15%? that means nothing would have changed for dan, the only thing you've changed is the incentive for the rich to give their money away. \\n\\npoint 2 (mortgage deduction)\\nso you're telling me that what $362 is to dan, $960 is to steve? you said the savings were 3x as much for steve. let's compare steve's income to dan's. 500,000/30,000 = 16.667 or 16. so steve makes 16x as much as dan makes and saves 3x as much as dan does. so his incentives don't reflect the wage gap. \\n\\npoint 3 (earned wage vs. unearned wage)\\nsimilar to point 1, you stated that two people in earned/unearned wage categories both make $500,000 a year. this is a misconstrued premise. a point you forgot to mention about the unearned wage category is that they do not make a steady income as do the earned wage category. let's take for example a house flipper, their income depends on how successful they are at updating the house, location, economy, and several other factors i'm not knowledgeable enough to state. the reason for the gap in deductions between the earned/unearned wage categories is because the unearned does not make a steady income. so the correct premise for this discussion is an earned wage worker makes 500k a year and an unearned wage worker makes 500k a year but other times makes 250k. so if we want to discuss this, we have to look at individual sectors and look at how often do unearned wage workers make the low end of their unearned wage in each sector. based on patterns we can discuss deductions for unearned wage workers in each individual sector (stock market, house flippers, etc.). so if individuals in a specific sector consistently make the top end of their wage, we can adjust their deductions to look more like the earned wage worker. \\n\\nbias is when a point is presented in a specific light to make the unbiased viewer shift to adopt the opinion projected by the presenter. if a point is presented in red the viewer will see it in red. present day media everyone. no more discussions just brainwashed democratic socialists and always trumpers. \\n\\nlet's discuss these topics but let's do it in the right way. the capitalistic theme overhangs all of these tax deductions and i think we should discuss those bigger topics instead of these smaller derived ones. capitalism vs. socialism. i think capitalism works and socialism does not, relative to the world our poor class is richer than the middle class of other countries. we must fight for the less fortunate, but let's look at things logically and not emotionally.\n","4211\n","False\n","as a cpa, i find i disagree with much of what is said in this video.  dan & steve save on taxes in different amounts because they are in different tax brackets.  no kidding.  however, you fail to see that steve is paying twice the rate in taxes! isn't steve a hero?  he's paying for someone else government entitlements. if he makes enough, he could be paying the way for 10 people, who knows?\\n\\nthe idea that if we take away certain deductions because it costs the government money is ludicrous.  it's not their money! the money you earn is yours, not the government's!  you and i don't live for the benefit of the government, the government works for us... and should do it on a budget.\\n\\nthe idea that all these deductions are not fair to the poor is bogus.  if dan bought a house for $100k and earned $30k a year, he probably wouldn't itemize his deductions because the standard deduction would likely be much higher.  the tax law gives him a freebie and he doesn't have to own a home to get the benefit.  if he's single and younger than 65, it is $6,300, married couples get double that. the new tax law proposed would double the standard deductions!  way to go dan! you're going to save a lot more money on taxes. i and many other home owners who are able  itemize our deductions (deducting mortgage interest and property taxes), however, are not so fortunate. the current plan is to eliminate the property tax and state income tax deductions.  so now dan can double his deductions and i lose about 25% of my itemized deductions.  i will pay a lot more in tax than dan, but because i own a home and am rich it's only fair that i should lose some of my deductions.\\n\\nhere is some more misinformation.  gambling losses are deductible up to your winnings.  you can never get a tax advantage losing money at a casino.  business meals are only 50% deductible and 9 out of 10 times, it's deducted on a small business return (schedule c).  if you run your own business (sole proprietorship) and see that you get to pay self-employment tax (15.3%) and income tax, you'd wish the irs would let you deduct 100% of those business lunches.  yes, big businesses get the same deduction too so i don't see the real advantage for the big guys (corporations).  retirement account contributions are deductible for everyone.  deductions for your income tax preparation fee is subject to a 2% of agi limitation.  basically, if you can itemize your deductions, you can deduct the portion of your tax prep fee that exceeds 2% of your income.  so if you make $100k, the first $2000 of your tax prep fee is not deductible, anything beyond that is.  you might have some other types of expenses in this category, but by and large, there are aren't many taxpayers with those types of deductions.  oh, and no one earning $100k pays and accountant any where near $2000 for their tax return. \\n\\nin 2013, the top 5% of taxpayers (agi of about $180k or more) paid 59% of all the income tax.  the bottom 50% paid only 3%.  the progressive tax system is working exactly as the government has designed it.  the rich pay more, the poor pay little or nothing.  on a side note, they failed to mention the earned income credit... you know, the cash the irs will give you if you earn too little?  this is especially helpful to those with children. if you have three children and your income is just at the right level, you can get over $6000 paid to you.\\n\\ngood grief!  now capital gains??!! when capital gains tax increase you have billions of dollars stuck in properties, stocks, and any other appreciating assets.  people are less likely to sell their stock if they have to pay up to 34% (combined fed and ca on their investments).  also as the assets appreciate, no one ever mentions that part of that appreciation is in the form of inflation so the true gain is not what you think it is.  your investment isn't as valuable as you think because inflation eats away at some of it, but the tax code doesn't care.  you pay the full tax on the growth, not its true purchasing power.  and what if you make a bad investment?  if you sold ibm stock for a $50,000 loss and had no other capital gains, you get to deduct $3000, not the full $50,000.  thank goodness you can carry the remaining $47k loss to the next year and deduct another $3k if you again don't have any capital gains.  people who invest money are not evil.  warren buffet is in a lower tax bracket but i'll bet his total tax is at least 1000 times what his secretary pays. \\n\\nyou might double check me on this one, but i believe hedge fund managers get paid a salary... plus bonuses.  so they pay the same tax as steve. i'm not aware of managers getting compensated in mutual funds or whatever they are indicating here.\\n\\nso cutting the top tax rate helps the wealthiest. that makes sense since 50% of our fellow citizens pay 3%.  the whole subliminal tone is that rich people are somehow cheaters because they aren't paying more than they already do.  why vilify those who earn more?  i'd bet 99% of the those in the bottom 50% would love to be in the top 50%. why is it bad when someone else is wealthy but not when i'm wealthy? this video just pushes that narrative.  \\n\\nhmmm... they seem to have  forgotten to mention the alternative minimum tax... you know the one that ensures the richest americans pay a minimum amount (about 28%) no matter the deductions or credits they have.  oh did they fail to mention that because congress can't get its act together, the amt tax affects a greater amount of tax payers than it ever has... and by that i mean middle class.  the threshold income numbers haven't kept up with income so it affects more and more tax payers. \\n trump talked about repealing it.  this would be a huge benefit to the middle class.  \\n\\nfinally, the idea that somehow income has to be equal is idiotic at best.  if every ones' wealth goes up but those on the higher end see their wealth grow faster,  how is that bad for the guy on the lower end?   his income went up too. this income disparity is always couched in such a way that rich people earn more and poor people earn less.  that's not true.  we act like no one can become richer if they didn't already come from a family of wealth.  there are millions of americans that love what they do and don't find gratification in earning tons of money.  these are choices we all make. anytime a government tries to make things equal it inevitably means pick on the rich and pander for votes from the poor.  this is all for political expediency... at least, that's my two cents.\n","6583\n","False\n","#wakeup #riseup #bringbackliberty:statue_of_liberty: #votelibertarian :ballot_box_with_ballot: #wildstarforgovernor2018 #wildstar2018

misleading statements made here.\\n\\nfirstly, many people have criticized reagan for trickle down economics, but now this video says his economic policy was good. come on. you can't call his ideas good only when you are trying to make someone else's look bad. reagan's plan included charitable deductions and home interest deductions, so please don't pretend that he was doing something much different. plus the current gop bill is pushing for closing carried interest, which is something no hedge fund manager or real estate investor would ever want to happen, as it would substantially increase their effective tax. this strangely is not even mentioned. it also failed to mention that dan would pay less in tax even with a 12% tax bracket since the standard deduction would shield over $12k of his income from taxes, which means it's mathematically impossible for him to pay more taxes if that plan were enacted as described.\\n\\nnext, this video is saying that dan gets less of a benefit than steve on many things. unfortunately, this video is missing the point entirely. dan gets more benefit than steve relative to dan's level of income when it comes to mortgage interest deductions. \\n\\nexample:\\n\\ndan saves $362 from his interest deduction, which is equal to 1.2% of dan's income. steve saves $960 on same sized interest deduction, which is equal to 0.2% of steve's income. in other words, dan gets six times the benefit relative to his income than does steve. this is a consequence of a progressive tax system.\\n\\nbut what if dan and steve both paid 15% income tax. that would eliminate this problem altogether, would it not? now steve would pay $362, just like dan. obviously, that's not what the people making this video are advocating.\\n\\nfurthermore, saying that the wealthy benefit mostly from mortgage interest deductions is silly, because a household making $200k a year isn't wealthy. it's middle class. the middle class disproportionately benefit from mortgage interest deductions. the genuinely wealthy usually own their home(s) outright.\\n\\nanyway, as others have already noted, higher income earners pay a greater share of taxes by far then the percent of income earned:\\n\\nin 2013, the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers (those with agis below $36,841) earned 11.49 percent of total agi. this group of taxpayers paid approximately $34 billion in taxes, or 2.78 percent of all income taxes in 2013. in contrast, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers (taxpayers with agis of $428,713 and above), earned 19.04 percent of all agi in 2013, but paid 37.80 percent of all federal income taxes. in 2013, the top 1 percent of taxpayers accounted for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined. the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid $465 billion, or 37.80 percent of all income taxes, while the bottom 90 percent paid $372 billion, or 30.20 percent of all income taxes.\\n\\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2015-update/\\n\\nbottom 50% were 11.49% a income, but paid 2.78% on income taxes.\\ntop 1% were 19.04 percent of income, and paid 37.80% of income taxes.\\n\\nclearly, the top shoulders more than their representative share of taxes, many times more.\\n\\n\\n\\ncapital gains is not about frequently buying and selling stock. if you do that, it's taxed as regular income. the only exception to this is futures contracts, which is why people with modest portfolios got into managed futures accounts in the last decade since it did allow part of the profits to be taxed as if they are capital gains. however, equities (stocks, bonds, etc.) will always be taxed as income if profits are realized within a calendar year after those assets were purchased. if you hold them longer than a year, then they are not. generally speaking, people who are in the stock market just hold their stocks for years and years. if you have a 401k, this includes you.\\n\\nthe hedge fund manager example is misguided too. if laurie has her own money in the hedge fund, then profits she earns on her money will be taxed as capital gains as long as time it took her to make that money exceeds one year. however, any share of the profits she gets from client's money is taxed as income to her, but would be capital gains to them as long as the hold time was long enough. \\n\\nwarren buffett is a stakeholder in berkshire hathaway, which is his investment company who's assets are the stocks the company is invested in. since berkshire issues its own shares, and buffet owns about 11% of those shares, and he is a long term investor, his income is taxed as capital gains. however, if he was not a stakeholder but derived income as a salary, then he would pay a higher tax rate. the point is that your income tax as a fund manager is dictated by what equity you have in the fund. if you have none but you are paid to manage the fund, then you will pay regular income tax.\\n\\nlastly, as far as charity is concerned, if you do the math you'll see that if your tax rate is above 50%, then you should give half your earnings to charity as you will take home more money overall, but if the tax rate is below 50% then it's better to not give to charity at all if you want to take home as much money as possible.\n","5313\n","False\n","around the world around the world around the world around the world around the world around the world around the world around the world around the world around the

the whole thing. i recommend that the people interested in this subject make some more research if this video is the only thing you have seen about this subject. there are some big pieces of information missing like the fact that dominican republic had to fight for its independence from haiti (like other commenter said).\\n\\ni think that this video is biased in favor of haiti. i also have to admit that i'm biased in favor of dominican republic, because thats my country, were i've live all my life, from were i'm writing right now. i think that it's true that there is racism in dominican republic, against black people from any part of the world, including black dominicans. i think that is true that we have xenophobia against haitians. we also have machismo and homophobia and lots of other problems in various degrees spread in the population. but so does any other country in the world, included haiti. thats not an excuse, a lot of people here in dr fight against those problems, i do. but i also think that as a free and independent country we should have a better control of our frontier. of course paying the right respect to our brothers haitians. that said, in general most of the dominicans live in peace with haitians, even knowing if they have or don't have papers and with black people, dominican republic have a lot of black people as you could saw on the video.\\n\\nbut we are also a poor country, our gdp that looks good for our small country is badly administrated and badly distributed. we have a lot of corruption too and part of that corruption is reflected on the way the frontier is administrated. the little bit of resources that really get to our hospitals have to be shared with haitian womans who come here just to give birth, and they get the attention, for free. that is why they keep coming. but the thing is that dominicans have to take care of dominicans first, and all the problems we have, in health, in education, in nutrition, we

comment about them doing it..... always been a fan of em,  favorite rap artist etc etc.  but now i'm not sure yo... this shit made no sense. almost like he just wanting black people thinking look guys,  i'm with you,  i'm rapping on behalf of you all,  look at me.  and trump never said anything bout black people,  or the black players  being spoiled rich  athletes etc etc.  and now all this gonna do is cause even more racist tension and issues that were not there before and don't need to be,  by saying what he just did and being as influential as the man is knows he has power to alot of people's to cause these shits,  dividing america. he's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man. he is a rich illuminati affiliated high up involved with agenda to rip us all part from eachother and all the ones that are saying your the shit em,  good job em,  ohhh he cares so much about all this shit , please wake the hell up peoples,  for real.  common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the hurd. funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, i bet everything,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. also waiting for everything to stop.... he aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if any of you believe that then i truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.  we as americans need to stick together with all colors  and sex.  real talk.  trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  ain't am easy job by any means period.  and fir anyone that's a believer of our lord and savior which i hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most definitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our president .  what this man just did or is doing i should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actually not!!! much more id like to say friends and things i know i probably forgot but its late, i'm very tired and gonna stop before i start going off in different directions off topic etc etc.  plus my wife is giving me that look,  ha. time for bed .  thanks everyone for your time and have a blessed day when your up.... take care and be safe.\n","3105\n","False\n","hey eminem, let me go ahead and spit at you!\\ni'm gonna tell you straight-up, dude, you're

wasn't a crime committed by muslims!! there was a stand down of us military fighter jets, when they knew the several planes had been hijacked! 10 of the hijackers are still alive and were freed back to their home country after several months of being held in the us. several even appeared on tv shows in their own country and did interviews. building 7 of the world trade centers had preplanted explosives all throughout the building before the attacks, placed by cia agents, one of which openly admitted on his death bed to  him and 3 others being ordered to place them as he was an engineer. the owner of the world trade centers 1 & 2 larry silverstien, then apparently ordered the firefighters to pull the building while it had been burning constantly for hours, which he himself unequivocally says he said to pull it in a famous interview which he later regretted. demolition  charges would take weeks to be placed all throughout the building, and firefighters do not even do that. that is not at all a part of their protocol or job training. larry silverstein took out an insurance policy protecting the buildings against terrorist attacks 2 months before the 9/11 attacks and profited over $7 billion from their destruction from the insurance policy. there were power downs of the world trade centers a week before the attacks in which engineers were walking in and out of the building unobserved by security. security of the building which was headed by g bush's cousin. explosives are how the world trade centers 1 & 2 were collapsed. fires alone do not burn hot enough to collapse industrial steel beams and there is extensive evidence to prove this. phone calls cannot be made from airplanes above 7,000 feet max and the planes travel too fast for the signal to smoothly be transferred from phone tower to phone tower and the phone calls are dropped, yet the records show phone continuous phone calls over 18 minutes on the hijacked planes and phony flight attendant calling back more than once. no plane hit the pentagon, it was planted explosives. there was no airplane debris characteristic to an airplane crash, the width of the building where the wings would have impacted still had fully intact windows. the hijacked planes were taken control over by a remote flight control system sold to the airlines in the 80's and had been around since the 70's where the military can take control over the airplanes controls and fly it like a drone in case of an emergency and the pilot isn't able. the hijacked planes were taken control of by this system, and landed at westover airforce base in western ma and hidden in hangers used for storing large c-5 transport planes, where the passengers were then gassed to death in the planes on the ground. one plane was not able to be taken over and controlled and landed at an airport in cleveland ohio due to the stand down of all airlines ordered by the airports. the hijacked planes were replaced in air with something different without it showing up on the radars which is a specific military operation protocol to replace a plane with another and have it unknown. the air force base where the hijacked planes landed was completely locked out to military personnel for 3 days! due to a military/government drill taking place the day of 9/11 training for an all out war scenario. keep in mind this drill was planned and scheduled before 9/11 when the attacks took place. there is undeniable extensive evidence of all of this! this was not done by the america government we know and love but by corrupt entities in positions of too much power scattered throughout the us government and world with their own agenda actually something they were kinda born into. the zionist rothschild mossad is the collection of knowledge and mindset responsible for this extensive operation to take place. they forced bush to then commit war against muslims after the attack as the scapegoats. zionist jews did 911 and blamed it on the arabs, iraq are enemies of isreal and the us fought them for them. this whole war has been a manufactured plot to serve an elite few of others interests. and of course the story we have all known for over 15 years is manufactured! i know it is almost completely unbelievable at first but, there is countless clear facts and evidence that the story america was told was not the truth. the vietnam war was manufactured based on a lie of events in a similar way to serve an elite fews interests. god bless you.\n","4484\n","False\n","love it!!! it's so halarious seeing kylo ren

will choose to forget that you ever committed them.\\nthose who accept this gift will become sons and daughters of god, and no longer be separated from him. such will receive access to the holy spirit

(string theory, for example - my apologies to brian greene for my poor attempt that may butcher his excellent explanations (i'm only a lowly engineer - but a very curious and happy one  :)  )  this is an intriguing idea that the biological processes and physical world we live under are actually being simulated at the sub-sub-sub atomic levels, and therefore we are actually blobs of proteins and lipids evolving for real in this simulation.  seems to me a lot of trouble to cover conscience awareness of each being if you can simulate the real universe down to whatever the real truth is (23 dimensional strings vs 10 dimensional, closed vs. open, vibrating vs. whatever)\\n\\n the same argument you made for the very big, godlike civilization would also apply to this thought experiment.  but there are already some heavy hitters on it.  several publications of proposed tests have been written, and are quite entertaining to even this lowly engineer.  (but still a science geek).  my personal favorite so far is the holographic paradox.  how does this quantum-level simulation stand up to what we know of black holes, where quantum fails?

(a 54% increase over prior years)\\n\\nso basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. all 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\\n\\nthis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. that is an average because some states have much higher rates than others. for example, california had 1,169 and alabama had 1.\\n\\nnow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? california, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. it is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. so if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\\n\\nare 5,100 deaths per year horrific? how about in comparison to other deaths? all death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. that's why they are criminals.\\n\\nbut what about other deaths each year?\\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–there is no excuse for that!\\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths\\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) \\n\\nnow it gets good:\\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. you are safer in chicago than when you are in a hospital!\\n\\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. it’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! so what is the point? if obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). a 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!\\n\\nso you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? it's pretty simple.:\\ntaking away guns gives control to governments.\\n\\nthe founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the british did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. it is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\\n\\nthus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the u.s. constitution. it must be preserved at all costs. \\n\\nso the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from noah webster: before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in europe. the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the united states. a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.\\n\\nremember, when it comes to gun control, the important word is “control, not “gun.\n","4384\n","False\n","spot the difference

dislike the people i just dislike what they do but that's there choice i don't have the right to judge. \\n\\nmy comment is.. is anyone else hoping they don't put a homosexual in this film. reason i'm asking is i just watched the new ep star trek discovery last night and once again we are forced a homosexual even tho the story didn't need or benefit from there being one. there seams to be this trend at the moment where a person of that sexuality is shown off as a amazing person who we should all love even tho it's takes away from the story think back to the last star trek film what dose everyone remember from that film bet it wasn't the story i can't even remember the name of it all i remember is the fact that zulu is a homosexual and that because it was forced even the original actor of zulu said it was too forced. when you do that it takes the whole focus of the movie off the story and on to them. \\n\\nnow this is far from being star wars but downtown abbey did it best that show had the butler who was a homosexual but it wasn't forced in your face he was just a part of the story and he wasn't shown off as this amazing person infact he was the villain of a number of episodes so if your gonna add someone like that in do it so the people who don't care can still enjoy the story without it being forced in your face. \\n\\npersonally i would like it of they just stopped adding them in to movies or storys not becuse i dislike them but because it takes away from the story.\\n\\nin ten years we should look back on this star wars as having a great story we should not look back in 10 years as this being the first star wars with a homosexual that's not what star wars was about.\\n\\nwhat i'm trying to say is if you wanna have a homosexual in a story add them on the first ep or first movie don't add them half way through just for the sake of it. star trek was about the crew saving the galaxy exploring the galaxy and getting in to trouble it was never about who likes who but that's what it's like today. star was has always been about good battling evil and that how it should stay. \\n\\nin a nutshell don't add them just for publicity or just for the sake of it if your gonna add them do it so it dosnt come across as being this big part of the story.\\n now please don't send hate all i wanna know is dose anyone else feel the same or is it just me. i will delete this comment if it gets to much attention. and i don't dislike homosexual people i just don't agree with what they do but what they do is there choice and i'm not judging because it's not my place\n","2667\n","False\n","wtf is my mans illness.  cause colin protested and trump made a comment about them doing it..... always been a fan of em,  favorite rap artist etc etc.  but now i'm not sure yo... this shit made no sense. almost like he just wanting black people thinking look guys,  i'm with you,  i'm rapping on behalf of you all,  look at me.  and trump never said anything bout black people,  or the black players  being spoiled rich  athletes etc etc.  and now all this gonna do is cause even more racist tension and issues that were not there before and don't need to be,  by saying what he just did and being as influential as the man is knows he has power to alot of people's to cause these shits,  dividing america. he's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man. he is a rich illuminati affiliated high up involved with agenda to rip us all part from eachother and all the ones that are saying your the shit em,  good job em,  ohhh he cares so much about all this shit , please wake the hell up peoples,  for real.  common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the hurd. funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, i bet everything,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. also waiting for everything to stop.... he aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if any of you believe that then i truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.  we as americans need to stick together with all colors  and sex.  real talk.  trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  ain't am easy job by any means period.  and fir anyone that's a believer of our lord and savior which i hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most definitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our president .  what this man just did or is doing i should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actually not!!! much more id like to say friends and things i know i probably forgot but its late, i'm very tired and gonna stop before i start going off in different directions off topic etc etc.  plus my wife is giving me that look,  ha. time for bed .  thanks everyone for your time and have a blessed day when your up.... take care and be safe.\n","3105\n","False\n","hey
